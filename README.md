* Creates an Airport with a custom capacity. The capacity for the airport can
also be set at creation by the user.
* Creates a plane that can be requested to land and take off by the airport.
* A plane can not be requested to land or take off by the airport unless they
match the airborne status which is held by the plane.
* A plane can not land at an airport if the airport is at maximum capacity.
* The airport will confirm whenever a plane has successfully landed or taken
off.
* The plane logs a timestamp when it has landed or taken off.
